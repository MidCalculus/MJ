# You are going to need 3 requirements to complete the hotel system mission.
# One: the login system:
# You are going to need to create a list for the sign ups, logins, duration of stay, name, and dates.
# Two: Room rates and fee:
# You are going to need to calculate, for each customer, an assigned room, I suggest you make a list, and make an order for each person to be assigned a room, also, the business,
# and hotel suite all have their costs and seperate rooms, so keep in mind for that.
# The last thing you are going to need, is the functions defining all of these, what you can do, is first create a login function, adding the begginning things, but also have a
# sign-in, and some sort of passcode protection for the login, * Look at the login program for more stuff about it*
# You should also have an entirely seperate function for date of arrival, customer stay time, types of rooms, and the prices, and be able to make a list to assign each person a room
# Finally, you need to have booking it, make sure to have a limit for the amount of people that can stay at the hotel.
# Thats it, so...
# Good luck!
